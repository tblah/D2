Makefiles will be written to work with iverilog (which is free *as in freedom*
software) because this makes Tom E happy and I got here first. It is a command
line verilog simulator. I don't see any reason this would not work in whatever
uni mandate we use.

d2lib.v should not be edited. This is the library provided forus n the ELEC2205
module page.
