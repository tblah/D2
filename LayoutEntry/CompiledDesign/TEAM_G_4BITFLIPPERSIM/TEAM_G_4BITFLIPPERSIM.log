*** 3 WARNING MESSAGES GENERATED DURING SETUP

Warning : Newton solver has failed due to extremely large node voltages.
        : If the circuit has very high gain and extremely large voltages (>1000V) are expected,
        : then you may use '.option vmax=0' to disable this check.
Conventional DC operating point computation failed.
Gmin stepping succeeded
Final gmin value = 1e-012, dcstep = 0
